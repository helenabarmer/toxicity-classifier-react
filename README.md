## Tensorflow.js
- [Pre-trained TensorFlow.js models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models)
- [Toxicity classifier from Tensorflow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity)

## To-do
- [x] Implement the pre-trained [toxicity classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity) in the code
- [x] Add React

## Deployment
Deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), explore it [here](https://react-toxicity-classifier.herokuapp.com/).
