This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Toxicity classifier
Toxicity classifier from tensorflow.js.
Will detect if the sentence you write in the input contains toxic content.

## Dataset
[**Toxic Comment Classification Challenge from Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data)

## Tensorflow.js
- [Pre-trained TensorFlow.js models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models)
- [Toxicity classifier/Tensorflow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity)

## To-do
- [x] Implement the pre-trained model in the code
- [ ] Add tests
- [x] Add React
- [ ] Use cases for a toxicity classifier
